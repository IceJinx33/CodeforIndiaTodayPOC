This project was a prototype for a job finding app targeted at Indian workers looking for work after being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Android app was coded using Flutter and Dart for the frontend. The backend was coded using SQLAlchemy (Python) and deployed on Heroku.

## Worker View
The app allows workers to create an account with their personal details, edit those details and even delete their account. Workers can see jobs listed along with further details about the job, and choose to apply if the job interests them. Workers can also see a list of their submitted applications, along with the status of their application. Workers can also choose to withdraw their application if they wish to do so.

## NGO View
The app allows NGO representatives to create an account with their personal details, edit those details and even delete their account. These representatives can see posted jobs as well as create new job postings. They can also click on the jobs tiles to see further details about the job, see applicants for the job, update job details as well as delete the job. They can also accept or reject candidates for each job.
